# quora-question-pairs
detection of question repeated questions

__This is a sesond attempt at the Quora questions kaggle challange i worked on a few years back using classical features.__<br>
In this iteration I first attempt to use word2vec embeddings, then bert embedings, and finally training embeddings with the model.<br>
The final model implemented is Siamese LSTM to classify pairs of sentences as either the same question or different.<br>
